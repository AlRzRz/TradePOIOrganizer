This script is meant to aid in trade management/organization. It acts as a journal that simplifies
writing down points of interest in any market.

*POI = Point of Interest*

Current functionality:

**READ MODE**: Reads out the POI's you have added previously to the script. Only works if you have
previously added POI's using this script.

**UPDATEI MODE**: Updates individual assets with new POI's and leaves the rest alone. If asset is not
found, you will be asked whether or not you would like to include the asset into your POI's.

**UPDATEA MODE**: Retains all assets but goes through each of them to update their POI's.

**WRITE MODE**: Run this if you have never ran this script before. This mode lets you chose which assets
you would like to include and adds functionality for adding their POI's. If you already have POI's, this
mode will wipe your previous POI's and run the previously stated functionality.


**How it works:**

* Script will come alongside a txt file. All reading and writing will be done from/to this txt file.



**Incoming functionality:**

* Alert System (Will alert you if a certain threshold has been passed or if you are within a certain
percentage amount of a threshold.)

* Live exchange info.
